## Design Phases

**Phase one - Wireframe**

Me and my team members spent the first day drawing the wireframe for the website. We checked out other websites for inspirations and we tried to figure out the best layout for this project.

**Phase two - Sketch app**

I created/designed the UI details in Sketch and then I exported my Sketch design as a pdf so that me and my teammates could use it as a reference when coding. We tried our best to make the actual website look as close to my Sketch design as possible within the limited amount of time we were given.
